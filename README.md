## My process

First I studied the pictures provided by Frontend Mentor inorder to figure out how to structure the html with necessary classes. Next I took my time to style it. It was a hard yet exciting process considering it is my first time doing this kind of a project by myself, without a guide tutorial.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flex Display
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is something I learned through this project. At first I strugled to fit the image into the card. But after doing a little research I figure out the solution. By setting width 100% it fits in to the entire width of the container which is in this case is the card.

```css
.card__header .card--image {
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still a little bit lost in flex area. I struggled a lot aligning the card into the center of the viewheight of the browser. So I would like to do more projects on that area an improve my skills.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp) - This helped me to figure out the way to fit the image into the card.
- [Example resource 2](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/css-grid-how-to-center-cards/225548/4) - This simple snippet of code helped me to figure out that I can use flex to align the card easily to the center.
